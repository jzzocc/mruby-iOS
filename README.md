## About

This is a pre-built version of [ios-ruby-embedded](https://github.com/carsonmcdonald/ios-ruby-embedded) for use with [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods).

## Installation

I haven't submitted this to the CocoaPods master spec repo because mruby is still under rapid development and constantly changing. If you want to include it in your project add this to your podfile:

```
pod 'mruby-iOS', :git => 'https://github.com/jzzocc/mruby-iOS.git'
```

## License

MIT to match the mruby license. See the LICENSE file for full license.

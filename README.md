## About

This is a pre-built version of [ios-ruby-embedded](https://github.com/carsonmcdonald/ios-ruby-embedded) for use with [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods).

## Installation

I have not submitted this to the CocoaPods master spec repo because mruby is still under rapid development and constantly changing. If you would like to include it in your project then add this to your podfile:

``` ruby
pod 'mruby-iOS', :git => 'https://github.com/jzzocc/mruby-iOS.git'
```

## License

mruby-iOS is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
